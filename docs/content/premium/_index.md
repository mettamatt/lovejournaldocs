Get the most out of Relationship Journal with premium features and benefits.

The free account let's you create moments, pair with a partner and measure the reserves of your relationship. However to get more out of the app we've made a premium plan available with the following features:

**Photo Filters**

A premium subscription unlocks all 10 photo filters. By default the photo filters are not enabled. You do not lose your edited photos if you downgrade to a free account.

**Location**

By enabling location, you can remember where each moment happens. By default your phone will use its built-in GPS feature. However if you add a photo to a moment the Relationship Journal will use the location information within the photo.

**Advanced Statistics**

See where and on which day you and your partner have the highest and lowest moments.

**Touch ID Lock**

Protect your journal. When the Relationship Journal opens, it will prompt you to unlock the app with your Touch ID.

**Search Moments**

Find your moments faster with search. Only available in Premium.
