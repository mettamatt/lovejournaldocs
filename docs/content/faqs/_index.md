## Pairing and Unpairing

### Can I pair with more than one person at a time?

No. If you want to pair with someone else you must first unpair with your current partner in the Settings menu.

### What happens when I unpair with my partner?

When you unpair with a partner two important things happen:

1. The moments you created are not deleted and they stay with you. 
2. All moments shared by either you or your partner are no longer shared. 

You can optionally choose to remove all your moments in your settings. Once you do this though, your moments are gone forever. You may also choose to delete your account. 

When you want to pair with another partner you will be given the option to remove your existing moments as part of the new pairing process. Some users use the app by themselves and want to import their moments into a new relationship. Other's may have moments from a different pairing and want to remove those moments ahead of time. Which is probably a really good idea.

### Can I try the app before I invite my partner?

Of course. Create an account and make a couple moments yourself to get the hang of it. When you’re ready to pair, visit the settings screen and enter the email address of your partner. They will receive an email with a link to download the app. Make sure they signup with email address you sent them.

## Moments

### What does the “Intensity Slider” do when creating a moment?

Every moment, whether High or Low, can be measured as Small, Medium or Large. When you create a moment and define the intensity you are changing the points which are assigned or deducted. Here’s the points for each moment and intensity level.

```
      [LOW MOMENTS]                         [HIGH MOMENTS]
  L          M            S            S           M          L 
--|----------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|--
 -15        -7           -5            1           4          8
``` 
                        
Generally speaking, most moments will be small ones, but big events happen and we know they can have a larger impact on the relationship. The intensity slider recognizes that not all moments are the same. Feel free to not use the intensity slider if you’d rather just capture the moments of the relationship without worrying about the details, but we’ve found the details to be helpful once you get in the habit of using Relationship Journal.

**Can I get bonus points?**

Well, aren’t you glad you read the documentation, Charle Brown! Yes. If you choose to share a moment with your partner you will receive an extra point for sharing. Otherwise all moments are private and for your eyes only.

## Relationship Score

### How does the relationship reserve work?
50 points or more fills up your relationship reserve.

Points come from creating moments. The soft goal is to create more high moments than low moments and build up your reserves. High moments are 1 point, low moments remove 5 points, and you are awarded an extra point any time you share a moment with your partner. Remember, your moments are always private unless you choose to share. The reserve just makes sure you have at least enough points to buffer about 10 low moments together.

The important part to remember here is to have fun. This is not science, but a way to be you honest with yourself while being more intentional about how you spend your time together.

### What are the Individual Reserves?
The individual reserves are the points from your own moments: they are your contribution to the relationship reserve. When you have 25 or more points your individual reserve will be at 100%.

You are able to view the individual reserve points of your partner, but never your partner’s moments unless they've chosen to share an individual moment with you. 
 
### Can my Relationship Reserve be negative?
No. If your score is currently negative, it simply means you do not have a reserve. There's no such thing as a negative reserve. Your reserve will instead be at zero and ready for you to create more high moments.
